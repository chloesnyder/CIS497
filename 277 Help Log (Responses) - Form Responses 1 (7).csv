4/1/2015 16:25:40,Debanshu/Adam,There was an issue with null pointers. Adam and Debanshu pointed out that I wasn't updating my global face list correctly
4/3/2015 15:58:54,Adam,I was referring to a list of vertex positions which was causing my vertices to be created with the wrong positions. Adam suggested I create vertices in MyGL and pass the array of vertices created into mesh. This fixed my problem.
